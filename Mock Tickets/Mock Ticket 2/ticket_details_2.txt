REQUIRED 
    - 

// Collection of required fields
var nameReqFields = ["NAME_TYPE_CODE", "LAST_NAME"];


If  existing flag TV_DEPTCTRL.USES_COMMENTS is 'R', make the comments field required. 
It should indicate that the field is required on save without user input from the field.

If existing flag TV_LABCTRL5.USES_QC_COMMENTS is 'R', make the comments field required. This should validate and display a required field popup on save without user input. You may check other existing validations in QC for your reference. 

In addition, please also check that the user input from comments field in Prelog gets imported to QC then gets inserted to TV_LABNAME on create.
When flag value is T, it should display the field like it used to without requiring user input.
When the flag value is F/NULL, the field must neither be displayed nor required.
