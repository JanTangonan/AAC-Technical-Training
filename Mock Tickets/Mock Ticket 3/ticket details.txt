Ticket Description:
Customer is requesting enhancements on the ChemInv header. Get the text from a stored procedure if it exists in the database.

If the chem category is C (Chemical/Purchased Reagent) or R (Prepared Reagent), check if the asset type is consumable (TV_ASSETTYP.CREATE_INITIAL_RECEIPT = T). 
    If it is consumable, the stored proc should return [QUANTITY] [QUANTITY_UNITS] of the chemical [ASSETTYP.DESCRIPTION] stored in [LOT_NUMBER]. 
    If not, then return A [ASSETTYP.DESCRIPTION] chemical stored in [LOT_NUMBER].

If the chem category is F (Firearms), return A [CALIBER.DESCRIPTION] [MANUINFO.NAME] [ASSETTYP.DESCRIPTION], model [INSTRUMENT_MODEL_NUMBER].

If the chem category is I (Instrument), return Instrument [ASSETTYP.DESCRIPTION]. If the next scheduled service in TV_CALINST is within 1 month, add Must be calibrated in [CALINST.NEXT_DATE].

If the chem category is D (Drug Standard), return a brief list of custodies the asset has been transferred (e.g East County - General Storage Lockers >> Analysts - Mike Evans). If the header is too long, cut it off at some point using â€¦

Use the current behavior from FORMAT_HEADING for other chem category.
