Ericka,

It appears maybe these changes were only done on the Officer Retention review dialog and not also on the Status Change screen of the Items Tab. I have set the LABCTRL5 flag to Hide the DNA Clearance Form and the Second Reviewer but they still show on this popup. I have cleared Cache and logged off since making the change and it still shows both. I will need this fixed for Onondaga and Master unless you find I did not do something correctly.

I did find there were 2 flags for the Second Reviewer and settings them both hide the field on the Items Tab so just the DNA Clearance is the concern.

Please work on the additional request below for APD Branch.

Currently when LABCTRL5.HIDE_DNA_CLEARANCE = T, the DNA Clearance form column is still being displayed in Items Tab>Status change pop up, please hide.
