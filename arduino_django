How the System Works:
1. Arduino + Django Integration
    - The vending machine (controlled by Arduino) sends data to Django via an API whenever a transaction occurs.
    - Django stores this data in a database.

2. Dashboard for Admins
    - Admins can log in and check dispenser locations, water levels, and earnings.
    - They can add new dispensers and set refill schedules.

3. Multiple Dispensers, Different Locations
    - Each dispenser has a unique ID and location stored in the database.
    - Django can generate reports per location to analyze performance.

4. Alerts and Notifications
    -Django can send an email or push notification if water levels are low.

Modules:
1. User Authentication & Management – Admins can log in to manage the dispensers, check reports, and track usage.
2. Dispenser Management – Add, edit, and remove dispensers across multiple locations.
3. Real-time Monitoring – Track water levels, coin transactions, and machine status.
4. Notifications & Alerts – Send an email or dashboard alert when a dispenser is out of water or experiencing issues.
5. Transaction Logs – Record every sale, including timestamps, location, and the amount of water dispensed.
6. Data Visualization – Show reports, charts, and trends on dispenser usage per location.
7. API for IoT Integration – The vending machines can send data to Django using APIs, which then updates the dashboard.
