Love, dreams, smiles
You will bring me, inside me
Break down the walls around me
How do you do it!

There seems to be a burning fire in your eyes
Raising me to be bold
Reminding me that I am a free person
You accept me for who I am.

A a a! ah! ah! hay!
I am blessed
To have you
A a a! ah! ah! a!
I raise my voice high
To say:
I love you!!! I love you
My voice to say I love you.

I love hearing your voice
Carrying me
Away from this world
A world that you have built for me.

And there is a burning fire that warms
That you have lit for us
And around it will be shared
All that is inside us.

A a a! ah! ah! hay!
I am blessed
To have you
A a a! ah! ah! a!
I lift it high.

My voice will declare:
I love you. I love you
My voice will declare that I love you.

Even the deepest waters
Cannot drown the love
That binds me to you
Nothing is impossible.

Hey! Hey aihey hey!
Haaah ah ah ah hey hey!
Ah ah ah ah hey hey!
Ah ah ah ah ah!! Ah ah ah ah!!

A a a! ah! ah! hey!
I am blessed
To have you
A a a! ah! ah! a!

I lift it high.

My voice will declare:
I love you!!! I love you
Everyone will know:
I love you!!! I love you
Everyone will know that I love you.

Oh oh oh oh oh ooh!
oh oh oh oh oooh!
